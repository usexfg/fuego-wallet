# Bundle macOS daemon dependencies into the app.
#
# The xfgo C++ daemons (fuegod, unified, xfg-swapd) link against homebrew
# dylibs at absolute paths (/opt/homebrew/opt/...). End users do not have
# those paths — without this step every C++ daemon dies with "Library not
# loaded" on a clean machine.
#
# Usage: bundle-macos-dylibs.sh <app_bundle_dir>
#
# Relocates all homebrew dylib references into Contents/Frameworks and
# re-signs everything (install_name_tool invalidates signatures).
#
# Failure handling: a dylib referenced by a daemon may not exist on the
# bundling machine (homebrew boost 1.90+ dropped libboost_system.dylib,
# header-only since Boost 1.69) and a bundled dylib may have no homebrew
# references at all (some ICU install names are bare file names). Both
# cases used to kill the script mid-bundle via `set -e`/`pipefail` — the
# former with a cryptic `cp` error, the latter with no error at all.
# Instead, bundling continues, and a final verification pass fails with
# the exact list of unresolved /opt/homebrew load commands, so a broken
# bundle is never produced silently.
